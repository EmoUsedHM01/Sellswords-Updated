The peasants step about the battlefield with long sticks, poking the earth like pelicans prodding over a pool of the most dangerous waters. %randombrother% comes over, cleaning the sludge off his blade, and asks if it is time to return to %employer%.

This seems a common sight nowadays, no doubt the dead climbing out of their graves being of some concern to men of philosophical takes.

You sirs have a good day.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% welcomes you into his room.%SPEECH_ON%My little birds tell me of the town being saved. You did well, mercenary, well enough in a world that\'s become so dark. Your pay of %reward_completion% crowns, as agreed upon.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is standing outside, staring toward a graveyard that has gathered quite a few residents since your last visit. He hands you a satchel of %reward_completion% crowns.%SPEECH_ON%You did well, mercenary. Word of your doings has spread across the land. One success won\'t save us all, but it puts us on the right path. If we are to win this damned war with the dead, we need as much spirit and hope we can muster.%SPEECH_OFF%Taking your pay, you add that sellswords need as many crowns as possible. You know, to keep their \'spirits\' high. The nobleman grins.%SPEECH_ON%I\'m being sanctimonious, not philanthropic. Get on out of here.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer%\'s guards take you into his room. He\'s got a few scrolls unwound all around him. Broken quill pens litter his table as though someone had splattered a bird there.%SPEECH_ON%Sellsword! Tis good to see the man of the hour, the day, the week! You did well in saving that town.%SPEECH_OFF%He throws you a satchel of %reward_completion% crowns.%SPEECH_ON%One victory to keep a town alive, one victory to keep the hopes of the people alive. I should pay you more. I mean, I won\'t, but I should.%SPEECH_OFF%You glumly take your pay, nodding back and responding.%SPEECH_ON%Well, it\'s the thought that counts.%SPEECH_OFF%The nobleman snaps his fingers.%SPEECH_ON%Exactly!%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% slunk deep in his chair with an even deeper frown. His clothes wink with shiny opulence and the candelabras look worth more than the servants holding them. The gaudy grouch despondently waves you in. He speaks slowly and sarcastically.%SPEECH_ON%One victory for man. One more victory to carry us to the next day. Mmm, thank you sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF%You slowly step forward, the servants glancing at you with fearful eyes. You take your pay and step back. %employer% waves you away now.%SPEECH_ON%Begone. I hope to see you again, lest you are of ill-shape and of dead body, then it would be a shame. Then again, that\'s how we\'re all going to end up, isn\'t it?%SPEECH_OFF%You say nothing and make your leave. It appears the war against the unending undead has worn on the nobleman.}",
