Through dark rituals and unholy pacts, it became an undead abomination that only survives by feasting on the blood of the living.";

Faced with the consequences of its twisted ambitions and the suffering it had caused, the necrosavant renounced its dark practices and sought to atone for its sins. Through acts of selflessness and compassion, it used its remaining powers to undo the harm it had wrought, restoring balance to the forces of life and death. In the end, the necrosavant sacrificed its own existence to ensure that no more harm would come from its dark arts, leaving behind a legacy of redemption and forgiveness.";

With each soul it ate and every corpse they devoured, its twisted ambitions grew ever more depraved, leaving a trail of death and despair in its wake. As their influence spread, %name% became a feared tyrant, ruling over a kingdom of the undead with an iron fist. In the end, %name%\'s lust for power consumed it entirely, leaving behind nothing but a desolate wasteland where only darkness reigned supreme.";

Maybe it\'s just uninteresting, or maybe just the opposite. | One rumor of the man says he traveled the land as a magician. | Rumors of magic surround the man, though some incredulous cynics are hardly impressed. | One rumor is that he was a conman, and another is that he\'s a sorcerer. You\'re not sure which you prefer. | With rumors of dark arts being practiced once more, the man\'s magical proclamation just might be true. | Some say he eats toads for breakfast and black cats for dinner.} {You ask %name% a lot of questions, but through some handwaves and nods, you realize you have forgotten his answers. Or did you ask the questions at all? | %name% produces a dove from his sleeve. An old trick that fancies no one - until it turns in the air, returning to him as a crow. | %name% has shown the ability to shoot smoke from his mouth. It\'s not fire, but it\'s close, and has people talking in hushed tones. | %name% floats a gold coin into the air. An amazing display that leaves the man too tired to attempt it again. | Predictions of the weather are common, but %name% is unusually accurate with his own. | %name% asks to read your palms. You decline. His presence alone is as close as you\'re willing to go. | %name% suggests that the stars are a roadmap to another world. He seems to know a lot about the heavens above. | %name% suggests that the heavens above are in fact just endless streams of beings, continuing on for eons. What a jest! | %name% points to one star in the sky and seems to suggest that is where he came from. You don\'t ask for a clarification on the matter.}";
