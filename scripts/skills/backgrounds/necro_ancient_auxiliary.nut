They serve and obey. That is all that matters. | This one is marked with cuts and nail marks, and still surprisingly fresh. | Come rain, snow or sandstorm %name% happily goes where they please. A truely free soul in a world of toil and dispair. If the world had more people like %name%, it would be a much better place. | This one is marked with stab wounds and cuts across their whole body. Many of which seem ancient in origin. | %name% is marked with wounds, many of which are fatal but have been carefully stitched shut or cauterized - suggesting that at some point, someone cared for this poor fark after death. Who the caretaker was will forever be a mystery however. | This one seems a little older than most, with barely any forms of battle damage across its carcass. Maybe this one died in a peaceful manner? Such things are rare in this world. | This one bares little evidence of a violent death, save for the noose marks around its throat. | With the rampant war and famile across the land, corpses like %name% turn up in droves these days. Mass graves remain uncovered, graveyards barely watched over. Perfect marketplaces to hone the dark arts. | The war of many names created a treaure trove of unliving recruits for necromancers. %name% is one such product of the conflict, seeminly a little more astute and reactive to orders than the average corpse - not that expectations are set very high or anything... | This one was bound and thrown into a river, however the main cause of death seems to be the dozens of arrows pocked across its body. The work of poachers, bored brigands or a vengeful feud come to an end.}{ Don\'t let the exterior fool you, when fresh game is involved %name% acts with sudden alacrity unbecoming their form. | The presence of anything living will drive this animal into a frenzy, no matter the size. | This corpse also comes with a small satchel of rusted coins, which are going to waste in their current state. You are sure it won\'t miss them anyway... | %name% lazily swings a rusted shortsword around as they plod aimlessly. | %name% is a fitting name, don\'t you think? It captures the struggle of this creature well. | While undead, these creatures are more like wild animals than brutal killers. | You poke %name% on what remains of its arm. It turns to look at you, then moves past you to chase a stray dog. You like this one. | %name% is still covered in clods of earth, sand and what else. This also gives you an idea... | The lifeless stare still takes some getting used to. The harder you look the more it feels like something is still in there. Something still human...} {You wonder how long it would take to teach this corpse to best a knight in battle. On second thoughts you aren\'t sure if you have that much time. | A victim of violence, %name% seems eager to continue the cycle of suffering. Perfect. | While clumsy, this create will make a fine addition to any collector looking to bulk out their macabre hobby. | You get the impression %name% would\'ve been an interesting person to know when they were alive. Oh well. | A victim of murder, lyncing or witchcraft, maybe %name% was just in the wrong place at the wrong time? | %name% almost seems to enjoy their new existance in unlife. | After all, who needs tiring muscles, decent pay and moments of sheer panic? Not this one. | Weathered and beaten, this one will make a fine addition to the collection. | Sometimes you feel guilty to treat these creatures as personal servants.} {Despite everything, the body is willing and the flesh is weak. But you get the impression this won\'t be a problem. | You jokingly hand the corpse a contract, and it looks at the parchment with some familiarity... | While cheap labour, you really hope you don\'t need to scrub out any armour it might end up wearing. | You push %name% and it manages to stay standing, which is more impressive than it sounds by walking corpse standards. | But with sharp teeth like that, who needs weapons? | %name% drops to their knees and attempts to eat the critters crawling in the dirt. This will be a long and fruitful relationship. | If anything, %name% will make a decent pack mule for all the things you don\'t want to carry. | The poor thing looks hungry. | On second thought, maybe %name% isn\'t memorable enough. Surely you can do better...'}";
