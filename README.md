**Introduction:**
Welcome to the overhaul/rework that is Sellswords Updated (SSU). This mod is a comprehensive overhaul and update of Chiru's original Sellswords mod. It includes full translations, updated graphics and brushes, new content, and complete compatibility with various large content-based submods like Accessory Companions, Magic Concepts, and PTR.

**New to Sellswords?**
For those unfamiliar with Sellswords, you can check out the original version [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/battlebrothers/mods/606)

**What exactly does SSU add?**
- Total Balance Overhaul
- Reworked Tooltips for enhanced clarity
- MSU mod config options so you can adjust the settings to your preference
- Roaming rival Sellsword companies - don't expect your allies to come to your aid!
- Two new Origins - Dryad and Sellswords
- New legendary locations
- New Legendary weapons tied to the locations and revamped old ones
- New Named weapons and armor
- Many new perks, such as armour masteries creating new synergies and bro builds
- Many new enemies added to spice up gameplay
- A revamped Favoured Enemy system that allows you to gain your perk points back
- Allows certain perks to be taken by AI factions, as well as players (ie enemies can have Freedom of Movement)
- Stackable arena fights (up to five arena fights can be taken in a day. Each fight takes a day to replenish)
- Sequences, a permanent buff potion that can be acquired by any origin, provided an anatomist is in the roster (not neccesarily in the combat)
- Tipped arrows/bolts, which can be looted from battle or bought. Some arrows/bolts can only be found in battle!

**Sequences:**
Sequences are essentially expanded Anatomist origin potions, heavily inspired by witcher mutations. Each unit can only take one sequence, two if they take the resilient perk. Keep in mind that strains within the same sequence are safe to take (ie direwoof and white direwolf can be taken by anybody). The Anatomist origin allows you to take one more sequence and has the morale mallus removed. The chance to get a sequence is multiplied by the number of Anatomists. 2 anatomists would double your chance to get a sequence. This multiplier is doubled on their own Origin. Strains can be obtained by fighting beast factions (this includes orcs and goblins). They are also rarely on sale at alchemist shops, or on certain enemies.

The % chance to get a strain from each enemy is:
- Alp - 2.5 Alp strain
- Direwolf - 2.5 - Alpha strain
- Greenwood Schrat - 5 - Greenwood strain
- Nacho - 1.25 - Glutton strain
- Goblin - 1.25 - Grubby fingers strain
- Goblin Leader - 5 - Grubby fingers strain
- Demon Alp - 5 - Demon strain

- Orc Berserker - 1.25 - Unga-Bunga strain
- Orc Elite - 1.25 - Unga-Bunga strain
- Orc Warlord - 5 - Warlord strain
- Orc Warrior - 1.25 Unga-Bunga strain
- Orc Warrior Low - 1.25 - Unga-Bunga strain
- Orc Young - 1.25 - Unga-Bunga strain
- Schrat - 5 - Barkskin strain
- Serpent - 2.5 - Ssssss strain

- Rock Unhold - 5 - Mountain strain
- Unhold - 2.5 Giant strain
